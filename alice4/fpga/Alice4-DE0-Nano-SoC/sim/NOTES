Route to fpgasim:
    Modify network_rasterizer.c to emit hardware protocol.
    Modify sim_main.c to listen to socket and take commands from there.
    Modify sim_main.c to forward screen to fpgasim (or other Mac program), either all at once
        or on the go.
    Or embed sim_main.c into fpgasim and hit it directly.

Look for XXX comments.

We forked Main.v, but see if we can integrate it back.
