            <h1>Alice&nbsp;1</h1>

            <p class="author">by Brad Grantham</p>

            <p>I lived in Santa Clara, California (south of the San Francisco Bay)
            from 1993 until 1994, and then in Santa Barbara (two hours north of Los
            Angeles) from then until the summer of 1995.  I spent a lot of time
            working on MacBSD during those years, but I also spent a lot of time
            thinking about what I thought I <em>was supposed to be doing</em>, which 
            was computer hardware.  (Now I'm much more honest with myself.  My
            goals are sitting on my ass eating uncooked cookie dough watching the
            Friends double header at 7 PM on UPN.)  In early 1994, I resigned from
            Altera because I wasn't producing results and felt thoroughly
            discouraged.  Self-loathing can be quite motivating, so I spent a lot
            of time working with MacBSD and experimenting with electronics, trying
            to accomplish and relearn a lot of stuff.</p>

            <p>Since the original goals of the Alice Project were still clearly in
            my head, I thought I would take the next step down the long road of
            educating myself.  Over those two years, I (re)learned how to build
            logic circuits and refined a procedure for printing my own circuit
            boards.  Most computer science programs include a course or two in
            electronic design.  I had forgotten most of mine but had most of my
            notes and textbooks.  With those in hand, I built some simple
            breadboarded circuits including a counter connected to a hexadecimal
            LED display and a static RAM (SRAM) test circuit.</p>

            <p>After I moved to Santa Barbara to work for
            <a href="http://www.tenon.com/">Tenon</a> on MachTen, I bought an EPROM
            programmer and decided to try to build a simple computer.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0141.jpg">

            <p>I designed and built a main board
            including a Z-80 CPU, RAM, and ROM.  I created a circuit
            diagram using <i>xfig</i>, but found it lacking some
            features I needed, so later I switched to <i>tgif</i>.  I
            wanted to print my own circuit board, so I created an
            initial sketch of the printed circuit using graph paper,
            and I routed the traces by hand.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0143.jpg">

            <p>I subsequently created an electronic version of the circuit master with
            <i>tgif</i>, but had to make several revisions because I was not working
            from a particularly thorough design.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0133.jpg">

            <p>The final main board turned out okay, including a switch to place the
            ROM at address 0.  My original plan was to build a second device that would
            connect to the main board through an address/data bus for debugging.  That
            way I could power the board up with the switch off, fill memory at 0
            with a test program, and then run that program.  It turned out to be
            too hard to implement and I basically left the switch turned on and
            always burned a new EPROM if I needed to change the program.</p>

            <p>A DB-25 connector allowed
            me to plug in an output board; I wanted to make some additional boards
            but finally decided to move on to Alice&nbsp;2 instead.  The one board
            I made decoded the I/O address 00H and output the data as two hex
            digits using 4495 hex-to-seven-segment-LCD-drivers.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0064.jpg">

            <p>A DB-9 connector
            connected the clock board to the main board.  This clock was controlled
            by a potentiometer and had a range something like from .1 Hz to 1 KHz.</p>

            <p>I found a free Z-80 assembler called <i>a-z80</i>, by William Colley, III.
            It worked really well for me for the prototype Alice&nbsp;1 and continued to
            work for us for Alice&nbsp;2.  I wrote some code to
            display the string <tt>C0dE15C0dE</tt>, or &ldquo;code is code&rdquo;.  When I ran the
            clock very slow, you could see the string slowly scroll across the two
            hex digits on the output board.</p>

            <p>One thing I found out immediately is that it's important to find
            a supplier nearby with a decent range of parts.  In 1995, there weren't
            very many great suppliers in Santa Barbara proper.  The nearest large
            electronics store was an hour North, in Santa Maria, and it's very
            frustrating to discover at 4 PM that you don't have a part and know
            that, even though the store doesn't close for an hour, you can't get
            there before it closes.</p>

            <p>Alice&nbsp;1 was a fun diversion in the evenings at Santa Barbara.  During the
            day I worked as the sole tech support engineer at Tenon Intersystems,
            the makers of MachTen, a UNIX execution environment for MacOS.  I spent
            a lot of time learning about graphics, NetBSD, and electronics
            when I was not at work.  Building an actual computer with CPU, RAM, ROM,
            and an output device was really inspiring.</p>
