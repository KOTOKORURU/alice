            <h1>Clock Board</h1>

            <p>The clock board's responsibility is to put a clock signal
            on the clock pin of the bus.  We wanted control over the
            clock speed, so we had switches to put the board into one
            of three states: single-step, variable, and full-speed.</p>

            <p>In single-step mode, a push button toggled the clock
            signal manually.  This was useful to debug the memory and
            CPU boards later.</p>

            <p>In variable mode, a potentiometer let us go from about
            0.1 Hz to 1 kHz.  This was useful if the section we wanted
            to single-step was far into the program&mdash;we'd run the
            program in this mode until the program got close to the
            problem section, then go into single-step mode.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0032.jpg">

            <p>Full-speed mode was 1 MHz using an
            oscillator.</p>

            <p>Three LEDs were useful in the above three modes.  The
            first LED showed the actual clock.  The second showed the
            clock divided by 1024, and the third divided by a
            million.</p>

            <p>The card also has a reset button, which just grounds the
            active-low reset pin of the bus.</p>

            <p>The clock board basically worked except for the
            variable mode.  We had taken the design from a magazine
            that used an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit.  This proved
            to be unreliable, so we later replaced this with a
            daughterboard that used a 555 timer chip.  The notebook
            page below shows the design with the RC circuit&mdash;we can't
            find the page with the design of the daugherboard.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0098.jpg">

            <p>When we later developed the CPU and
            memory boards, we ran
            into all sorts of problems that we were able to debug easily
            using the single-step mode and the debug board.  It's extremely
            important to develop good debugging tools early in any
            project.</p>
