            <h1>CPU Board</h1>

            <p>The CPU board has a CPU (a Zilog Z-80),
            an Intel 8259 interrupt controller, and some glue chips for
            the memory logic.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0013.jpg">

            <p>The Z-80 was based on the Intel 8080.  It
            added enough features that several late-70's computers were
            based on it, including the TRS-80 line.  It's available now
            for just a few dollars.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0015.jpg">

            <p>The Z-80 has only one interrupt pin.  It's often useful to
            have several different interrupting devices, each having
            different priorities.  The 8259 has four interrupt pins
            (IRQ0 through IRQ3 on the bus).  It arbitrates incoming
            interrupts, funneling them to the Z-80's only interrupt pin.
            It also puts the number of the interrupting device on the
            Z-80's data bus.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0102.jpg">

            <p>The CPU has four pins that control memory and I/O: memory
            request (/MREQ), I/O request (/IOREQ), reading (/RD), and
            writing (/WR).  We figured that
            a more useful version of these (for the other boards) would
            be memory read, memory write, I/O read, and I/O write.  For
            example the memory board
            would only have to decode the &ldquo;memory read&rdquo; bus line instead
            of needing to combine /MREQ and /RD
            with extra glue logic.  It turns out that this was a bad
            idea.  See the /MREQ line on the <A HREF="system_bus.html">system
                bus page</A>
            for details of this mistake.  Don't go second-guessing real
            hardware designers.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0103.jpg">

            <p>The CPU board is the only board that we made twice.  We had
            prototyped (in a breadboard) the CPU and glue logic, but had
            never tried the 8259.  We figured it was straightforward
            enough, and went ahead and made the PC board directly from
            design.  Bugs in interrupt hardware can be some of the
            hardest to find, since it's virtually impossible to
            single-step through the events.  We fought with flaky
            interrupts for the better part of a year before building a
            very cool logic analyzer (a few chips that piped wires'
            values into a PC's printer port).  We then instantly found
            our mistake.  Another testimony to the value of debugging
            tools.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0104.jpg">

            <p>We had misread the specs of the 8259.  We thought that it
            latched interrupts, and in fact it doesn't.  We had to
            redesign the whole board to get around this problem.  A few
            other mistakes and problems with the CPU board (missing
            pull-up resistors, missing inverters, bad socket for one of
            the glue chips) made this the most painful board to get
            running right.  For example, the problem with the bad socket
            was such that the chip's pin didn't connect with the socket,
            except if a voltmeter probe was pushing on the pin.</p>
