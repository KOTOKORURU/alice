            <h1>Debug Board</h1>

            <p>The debug board displays the state of the
            bus.  This includes two 7-segment LED digits for the data
            pins, four digits for the address pins, and ten individual
            LEDs: four IRQs (interrupt request pins), memory read, memory
            write, I/O read, I/O write, reset, and NMI (non-maskable interrupt).</p>

            <p>The design
            of the debug board is fairly straightforward.
            The individual LEDs are hooked up to the bus through
            inverters (since these lines are active-low) and through
            resistor packs.  The data and address pins go through
            4-bit-to-7-segment-LED chips (4495s).</p>

            <img src="../pics/0018.jpg">

            <p>We used the debug board extensively when building the memory
            and CPU boards.  We didn't use it after that because we couldn't
            run the I/O board any slower than full speed and that prevented
            us from doing single-stepping of the Z-80 code.</p>
