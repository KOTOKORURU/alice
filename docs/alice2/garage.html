            <h1>The Hardware Lab (A.K.A. the Garage)</h1>

            <img src="../pics/0001.jpg">

            <p>At first we worked on Alice&nbsp;2 in Brad's apartment on two tables in
            what would normally be a dining room.  When Brad moved to a house
            in Mountain View, we took over the garage (much to his roommates'
            distress) and set up a very large conference table for all the parts,
            etc.  This garage was the Alice design center for several years,
            even once or twice after Brad moved out of the house.  (Brad
            thanks his previous roommates and the current residents.)</p>

            <p>Because the garage wasn't previously set up for engineering, we
            brought in a space heater for the colder months (thankfully we
            had California weather) and placed two industrial-strength floodlamps
            underneath the storage platform above our heads.
            We also found it
            useful to place some reference materials on the wall opposite where
            we sat at the table.  You might be able to pick out the pinouts for
            the Z-80, common logic circuits, and the resistor color code.  If you
            look really carefully you can see a risque postcard from &ldquo;Jazz City New
            Orleans.&rdquo;
            And of course we put up Brad's old MACBSD license plate for nostalgic
            reminiscing.</p>

            <p>The garage was the site of many bad jokes and junk food gorging.
            The house on Williams Way was just a block away from a little food mart
            that we affectionately referred to as the &ldquo;Kwik-E-Mart&rdquo; in homage to <a
                href="http://www.thesimpsons.com">The Simpsons</a>.  We found that much
            of the time we spent &ldquo;working on Alice&nbsp;2&rdquo; was really all about laughing,
            talking about women we were dating, grousing about work, bitching about
            the sad state of software engineering today, or just chatting about
            whatever until we were too tired to think of anything else.</p>
