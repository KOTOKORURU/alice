            <h1>I/O Board</h1>

            <p>Once we had built the CPU and memory board
            we prototyped an LCD display for output from
            the Alice&nbsp;2.  Later we added an interface to a standard PC
            keyboard using an EPROM and microcontroller.  The
            microcontroller brought serial I/O for free.  Thus our I/O
            board gave Alice&nbsp;2 user input and output and a way for us
            to control Alice&nbsp;2 from another computer.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0025.jpg">

            <p>Before we had the I/O board, we built a simple LCD
            controller that plugged right into the alice bus.
            I mean, it was
            fun single stepping the CPU and watching the address and
            data accesses on the debug board, but that got boring real
            quick.  At first we used a backlit 1 line by 8 character
            LCD that Brad found cheap at Halted Electronic Supply, but
            later we ordered a 2 line by 16 character LCD (no
            backlight) from JDR Microdevices so that we'd have more
            room.  Brad thinks that the backlight was more important in
            the end than more room just because the garage was usually
            pretty dark.  The box in this photograph
            contained the LCD and the interface logic.  You can see two
            DB-25 connectors sticking out the top from which we ran
            cables to the Alice&nbsp;2 bus.  Both LCDs we used were typical
            of a lot of contemporary LCD designs; the host circuit
            sends <i>data</i> bytes to store ASCII characters on the
            display and <i>instruction</i> bytes to clear the display,
            set the cursor position, initialize the controller, etc.
            The interface board we built had a simple decoder circuit
            to turn I/O writes to address 2 and 3 into data and
            instruction writes.  You can read our Z-80 ROM library for
            accessing the LCD on our <a href="software.html">software
                page</a>.</p>

            <p>After we built the LCD controller, it seemed natural to design an input
            device.  At first we thought it would have been really cool to buy one of
            those surplus membrane keyboards that keep popping up.  But we realized
            that we'd have to build a complicated latching and interface circuit
            for such a beast.  So we finally decided to build a standard AT-style
            keyboard interface so we could use any old AT keyboard lying around.
            (And, at the time, Brad had several.)</p>

            <p>PC-AT keyboards (and PS/2 keyboards) use a pretty simple
            serial protocol to send keystrokes.  We went to the
            internet (our favorite reference) and found several
            descriptions of the keyboard protocol.  At first, we
            considered a simple latching circuit that would interrupt
            the Z-80 directly and allow it to decode the serial signal
            coming through.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0109.jpg">

            <p>While considering that design, however, we found that JDR
            Microdevices was selling several variants of Microchip's
            PIC 16Cxx microcontrollers.  We decided it would be fun to
            build a circuit with one of these microcontrollers that
            latched up the keyboard signal itself and then sent
            fully-formed keyboard scan code bytes to the CPU.  The Z-80
            would then convert these scan codes
            from the keyboard circuit
            into ASCII characters (taking into account the
            state of shift and control keys).  This circuit
            slowly developed into
            the I/O board.  The black console box shown above with the
            LCD also had the 5-pin keyboard connector in it, so we
            borrowed two bus lines to carry serial data from the
            console box to the I/O board.  (For extra luck we also put
            a reset button on the console box and tied that to the bus
            reset line.)</p>

            <img src="../pics/0140.jpg">

            <p>It turned out that the PIC 16C65 had a serial port built
            right in!  So we added a MAX232 voltage converter to the
            board and gave ourselves an honest-to-god RS232 serial
            port.  We later used this serial line to transfer programs
            and data from a PC running Linux.  The 16C65 also had
            several I/O pins left over after our needs were met, so we
            decided to extend those pins to yet another DB-25 just in
            case we wanted to use them for something.  This sketch
            shows the PIC microcontroller in the center
            connected to the Alice&nbsp;2 bus on the left, the MAX232
            voltage regulator at the bottom, and the spare connector to
            the right that exposed the unused I/O pins.</p>
