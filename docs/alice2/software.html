        <h2>ROM Library and Bootstrap Code</h2>

        <p>The memory board had an EPROM that mapped to the first
        16k of memory.  In it we stored the code used to initialize
        the system and some routines that would be useful to programs,
        such as writing to the display, getting a line of input
        from the keyboard, converting decimal to hex, and copying
        strings around.</p>

        <p>Before we got the serial port working, our programs had
        to be burned on the EPROM as well, since we had no other way
        to get data into the system.  The main routine was simply appended
        to the library code.</p>

        <p>Here are a few of the files we used regularly:</p>

        <table>
            <tr valign="top">
                <th>HTML</th>
                <th></th>

                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>

                    #includes the other library files, contains some test
                    scaffolding, has some interrupt-handling routines, and
                    converts keyboard codes into ASCII.  The include
                    of <tt>image.asm</tt> was for displaying precompiled images
                    on the monitor that was eventually added using the
                    video board.</td>

        <h2>PIC Code in I/O Board</h2>

        <p>The I/O board had a PIC chip to do most of the I/O work.
        The PIC chip had an EPROM built-in, which we programmed
        to communicate with the Z-80 CPU.</p>

        <p>Here's the <a href="Software/queue.src.html">HTML</a>
        and <a href="Software/queue.src">raw</a> versions of the
        source code.  Basically it's responsible for the following
        things:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Accepting a byte over the serial port and interrupting
            the CPU with it.
            <li>Accepting a byte from the keyboard and interrupting the
            CPU with it (raw byte&mdash;no ASCII translation).
            <li>Interrupting the CPU ten times per second.  (We never
            ended up using this feature.)
        </ul>

        <p>We developed a simple protocol so that we didn't have to use
        several interrupt channels.  Only a single IRQ channel was
        used on the 8259 and the CPU asked the PIC what kind of data
        was available.</p>

        <h2>C Compiler</h2>

        <p>Lawrence wrote a very simple C compiler, which compiled to
        assembly language.  (If you look at <tt>rom.asm</tt> above, you
        can see an include of <tt>zcc_out.asm</tt>.)  It wasn't used for
        anything but small tests.  It didn't support structures or
        floating point, but it did support pointers.  You can
        download the <a href="Software/zcc.tar.gz">source code</a>.</p>

        <h2>Operating System</h2>

        <p>We wrote a very simple multi-tasking operating system,
        but it was never even tested on the machine.  It worked
        under Linux when interrupts were simulated with alarm
        signals.  The C compiler never got far enough along to
        compile it.  You can download the
        <a href="Software/blan9.tar.gz">source code</a>.  It was
        called BLan9 as a pun on
        <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/plan9dist/">Plan 9</a>,
        the operating system from Bell Labs, and the BL stands
        for &ldquo;Brad and Lawrence&rdquo;.</p>

        <h2>Logic Analyzer</h2>

        <p>The problems we had with the CPU board drove us to build a
        simple logic analyzer that worked through the parallel port
        of our laptop.  This logic analyzer software recorded the
        values of four pins at up to 70 kHz.  The result could
        displayed, scrolled, and zoomed in an X Window window.  After
        fighting with the CPU board for months, we found the problem
        in hours with this program&mdash;it was obvious by comparing
        various signals that the 8259 wasn't latching the interrupt
        pins like we thought it did.  There's nothing like good debugging
        tools.  You can download the
        <a href="Software/anal.tar.gz">source code</a>.</p>
