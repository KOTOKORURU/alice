            <h1>Video Board</h1>

            <p>We're both graphics nerds (or were), so we decided it wouldn't be a
            real computer without some kind of CRT display.  So we built
            a video board that produced NTSC video output.</p>

            <p>At first, we spent quite a bit of time researching the NTSC timing
            waveform.  There appears to be a <i>lot</i> of variance in documented
            NTSC signal &ldquo;standards&rdquo;.  On the one hand, that made us nervous that we
            wouldn't be able to generate a decent signal, but on the other,
            it probably meant that modern TVs can handle a <b>huge</b> range of
            input signals, so maybe we'd be protected by NTSC's ambiguity.
            As a test, we borrowed the &ldquo;TV Typewriter&rdquo; video circuit from Lancaster's
            <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0750699434/lkesteloot">CMOS
                Cookbook</a> and built a ROM to drive it that we would clock at some
            high rate.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0093.jpg">

            <p>We built some source code to emit ROM images with whatever timing scheme
            we wanted on data pin 0 and a 1-bit black-and-white image on data pin 1,
            with a signal on pin 2 to reset the ROM address counters at the end of
            a frame.  We scanned out at 60 frames per second, even though &ldquo;real&rdquo;
            NTSC alternates a frame of even lines and then a frame of odd lines to
            scan a complete image at 30 frames per second.</p>

            <p>It turns out that, with a 64K ROM, at 60 Hz, you can run about 3.8 MHz
            and get 242 pixels on a video line before the ROM has to flip over.  We
            probably ran our initial test at 2 MHz, although we didn't write down the
            speed.  This worked <i>extremely</i> well, so we interfaced it
            to the Alice&nbsp;2.</p>

            <img src="../pics/0144.jpg">

            <p>Instead of driving the video signal from EPROM pin 1, we hooked it into
            a 128K RAM.   We wasted most of the 128K on the video board just like
            main memory, but it's what we had and it was easy.  It turned out very
            convenient that we had left a toggle on the memory board to mask out
            one 16K addressing region; it allowed us to map video memory into that
            region and allow direct CPU access.  The bus in from the CPU and out
            to the video encoder were connected directly together, so when we accessed
            video from the CPU you would see snow on the screen.  At first it seemed
            annoying, but later we found it very useful for indicating whether or not
            the CPU was correctly accessing the video board.  Modern VGA boards use
            either dual-ported memory so that the CPU can access video memory at the
            same time as video scan-out, or they alternate DAC and bus accesses so
            that they don't interfere.</p>

            <p>Because the RAM was scanned out continuously with the timing
            ROM, much of the video memory was outside the visible screen area.
            We ended up with roughly 200 pixels across by 170 pixels down.  We
            wrote some code to read a PBM image (a simple format storing one pixel
            per bit), center it, and draw an outline around it, storing the
            result into a file we could download through the serial port
            to video memory.  We had a lot of fun with that one.  In a very real
            sense, we built an NTSC framebuffer and attached it to a PC.</p>
